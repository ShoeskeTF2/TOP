        <p class="important-body">Pancakes are a delicious and versatile breakfast food that has captured the hearts and taste buds of people worldwide. These round, flat, and fluffy delights are made from a simple batter consisting of flour, eggs, milk, and a touch of sugar and salt. When cooked on a hot griddle or frying pan, they transform into golden brown discs with a slightly crispy edge and a soft, tender interior.</p>

        <h2 class="header" id="steps-header">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="step">Preheat a griddle or non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. You can test if it's hot enough by flicking a few drops of water onto the surface - if they sizzle and evaporate, it's ready.</li>
            <li class="step">In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. If you want to add any optional flavorings like vanilla extract or mix-ins like chocolate chips, you can add them to the dry ingredients now.</li>
            <li class="step">In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter until well combined.</li>
            <li class="step">Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently stir until just combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps in the batter; overmixing can make the pancakes tough.</li>
            <li class="step">Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle or pan and spread it evenly to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li class="step">Using a ladle or measuring cup, pour the pancake batter onto the hot griddle or pan. Use about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake, but you can adjust the size to your preference.</li>
            <li class="step">Cook until you see bubbles forming on the surface of the pancakes and the edges look set, usually about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li class="step">Carefully flip the pancakes with a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li class="step">Transfer the pancakes to a plate and keep them warm. You can cover them with a clean kitchen towel or keep them in a low-temperature oven while you cook the remaining pancakes.</li>
            <li class="step">Continue the process until you have used all the batter, adding more butter or oil to the cooking surface as needed.</li>
            <li class="step">Serve your pancakes with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
