        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>If you are making a meat sauce, brown the ground beef or sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it is no longer pink. Drain any excess fat, then add the tomato sauce and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>If you are making a vegetarian lasagna, sauté your vegetables of choice in a large skillet over medium-high heat until they are tender. Add the tomato sauce and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>If you are making a bechamel sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour until it forms a paste, then gradually whisk in the milk. Cook for 5-7 minutes, whisking constantly, until the sauce has thickened. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray or butter.</li>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of the baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles, then a layer of tomato sauce, a layer of cheese, and a layer of meat or vegetables. Repeat the layers until you reach the top of the dish, ending with a layer of cheese.</li>
            <li>If you are using bechamel sauce, pour it over the top of the lasagna.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the noodles are cooked through.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
