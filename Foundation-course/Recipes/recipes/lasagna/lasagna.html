            Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is beloved around the world. It is a layered pasta dish that typically consists of wide, flat noodles, tomato sauce, cheese, and meat or vegetables. The noodles are boiled until they are al dente, then layered with the other ingredients in a baking dish.

        <ol>
            <li class="step">Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
            <li class="step">Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li class="step">If you are making a meat sauce, brown the ground beef or sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it is no longer pink. Drain any excess fat, then add the tomato sauce and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li class="step">If you are making a vegetarian lasagna, sauté your vegetables of choice in a large skillet over medium-high heat until they are tender. Add the tomato sauce and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li class="step">If you are making a bechamel sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour until it forms a paste, then gradually whisk in the milk. Cook for 5-7 minutes, whisking constantly, until the sauce has thickened. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li class="step">Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray or butter.</li>
            <li class="step">To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of the baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles, then a layer of tomato sauce, a layer of cheese, and a layer of meat or vegetables. Repeat the layers until you reach the top of the dish, ending with a layer of cheese.</li>
            <li class="step">If you are using bechamel sauce, pour it over the top of the lasagna.</li>
            <li class="step">Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the noodles are cooked through.</li>
            <li class="step">Let the lasagna cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
