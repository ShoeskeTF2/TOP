        <h2 class="header" id="steps-header">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="step">Crack the eggs into a bowl and add a pinch of salt and black pepper. If you're using milk or cream for creamier eggs, add it to the bowl and whisk everything together until well combined.</li>
            <li class="step">Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add the butter or oil. Allow it to melt and coat the bottom of the pan evenly.</li>
            <li class="step">Pour the beaten egg mixture into the skillet.</li>
            <li class="step">Let the eggs cook undisturbed for a few moments until the edges start to set. Then, gently stir the eggs with a spatula, pushing them from the edges towards the center.</li>
            <li class="step">Continue to cook and stir the eggs periodically. They should be cooked but still slightly runny. This will ensure creamy scrambled eggs.</li>
            <li class="step">If you're adding any optional ingredients like meat or vegetables, you can add them when the eggs are nearly done. Stir them in and cook for an additional minute or until everything is heated through.</li>
            <li class="step">Remove the scrambled eggs from the heat just before they are fully set because they will continue to cook slightly from the residual heat.</li>
            <li class="step">Serve the scrambled eggs hot, garnished with fresh herbs or a drizzle of hot sauce if desired.</li>
        </ol>
